# SGS-Student-Grievane-System
Student Grievance System - Django Project

This App will accept any grievance from students and staff. If grievance contains any parliamentary word then the system will block that user
and it wont consider that grievance. System will assign severity and priority for every grievance. Severity and priority are cumulative. There
will be 4 thresholds. Any grievance cumulative count exceeds the first threshold; it automatically sends that grievance to the HOD. If it
exceeds the second threshold it automatically sends that grievance to the Principal. If it exceeds the third threshold it automatically sends
that grievance to the Director. If it exceeds the 4th threshold it automatically sends that grievance to the CEO. This system will hide the
details of the person who is hosting the grievance. This will be useful for management to know the right feedback and to take corrective
measures to improve the system.

Technologies used : HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Django.
